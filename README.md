# codeAlpha_Stock_Price_Prediction_using-_LSTM-
This repository contains a project focused on predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time-series forecasting. The project demonstrates the application of LSTM for stock market prediction based on historical price data.
